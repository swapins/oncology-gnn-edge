### Edge-Optimized Graph Neural Networks for Protein Interaction Network Analysis

A hardware-adaptive, numerically stable implementation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) designed for protein–protein interaction (PPI) network modeling in resource-constrained research environments.

This framework emphasizes:

* Sparse graph computation
* Stability-aware symmetric normalization
* Cross-device execution (CPU / CUDA auto-detect)
* Edge deployment readiness (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson class devices)
* Research-grade workflow tooling with GUI support

---

## Research Context

Biological systems are inherently network-driven. Protein interaction networks encode structural dependencies that are not captured by isolated gene expression analysis.

This project explores:

> Efficient, numerically stable execution of normalized Graph Convolutional Networks for molecular network representation learning under constrained compute environments.

The system is intended for:

* Translational oncology research
* Computational biology prototyping
* Network-level molecular representation studies
* Edge-deployable biological modeling

**Important:**
This framework is a research prototype. It is **not a clinical decision system** and is not validated for diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic use.

# Core Contributions

## 1. Stability-Aware Graph Convolution

Implements symmetric normalization:

$$H^{(l+1)} = \sigma(D^{-1/2} (A + I) D^{-1/2} H^{(l)} W^{(l)})$$

With:

* Degree clamping to prevent division-by-zero
* Explicit dtype handling
* Sparse matrix support
* Controlled spectral properties
* Deterministic inference behavior

This design prioritizes numerical stability in biological graph workloads.

---

## 2. Hardware-Adaptive Execution

The system:

* Automatically detects CPU or CUDA availability
* Supports optional FP16 execution (GPU-dependent)
* Maintains a unified inference API across devices
* Runs on:

  * Standard CPU laptops
  * Desktop GPUs
  * Embedded NVIDIA Jetson platforms

This reflects an **edge-first systems architecture philosophy**.

---

## 3. Sparse Graph Optimization

Adjacency matrices are supported in sparse COO format to reduce:

* Memory footprint
* Computational complexity
* Edge-device pressure

This is particularly relevant for medium-scale PPI graphs.

---

## 4. Research Workstation GUI

Includes a Qt-based dashboard designed for:

* CSV-based molecular data upload
* PPI network ingestion
* One-click embedding generation
* Real-time inference timing
* CPU/RAM monitoring
* Export of embedding results

Optimized for:

* Portable research workstations
* Touch-enabled 8-inch displays
* Edge-deployed lab environments
